This is the third round of work on the Spreadsheet Calculator for OS/2
and DOS, and consists of bugfixes only. A (fatal) problem in using
the regex routines has been corrected, and a number of fixes have
been made for various problems with dates, including work-arounds for
Microsoft C deficiencies.

The 32-bit executable is created with Mattes' GNU emx tools, and 
has "emx.exe integrated". It will run under OS/2 2.x or DOS (with a
386 or better), but will not run in a dos-box under OS/2 or Windows.
OS/2 users will need the emx runtime, available from ftp.cdrom.com
in pub/os2/2_x/unix/gnu/emx08h/emxrt.zip.

Additional work should probably be directed towards GNU Oleo, or
towards the new sc:

  Subject: Your sc status....

  I have a set of patches just about ready for a new version.
  Right now, except for the copyright (attached below) on the X part,
  sc and Xspread are the same. At the moment you either compile as xspread
  or sc depending on a flag (DOINGX), a merged version (auto selection-like
  emacs/oleo/etc.) would be the next step. [text deleted]

Preface to the second edition
-----------------------------

This is the second round of work on the Spreadsheet Calculator for OS/2
and DOS. The man pages *.man are intended to be read with the "less"
pager, available for OS/2, DOS, and Unix.

Major changes: Support '!' shell commands, /s sort, external
functions, regular-expression searching, and fixes and additions for
the Write and Tbl filenames.  Filename mangling is performed if the
filesystem is not HPFS.

Executables can be created for OS/2 and DOS with emx/gcc or msc. The
enclosed executables will run under OS/2 1.x--2.x and DOS, but memory
will be limited under DOS. A DOS-only version could save a few bytes.

See the update history below for the changes from the earlier port.

Update history
--------------

** 14-May-94 Darrel Hankerson hankedr@mail.auburn.edu

Bugfixes for regex and date problems. Using regex with certain
"illegal" expressions could cause an access violation (gawk 2.15.3 had
the same problem). Problems with date calculations were reported by
Janusz S. Bie/n <JSBIEN%PLEARN.BITNET@SEARN.SUNET.SE>. Some of the
original code was never implemented or integrated properly, and
brain-dead MSC required additional changes (the time routines from
Mattes' emx/gcc are used as replacements).


** 21-Nov-93 Darrel Hankerson hankedr@mail.auburn.edu

Added support for the usual '!' shell commands, /s sort, external
functions, regular-expression searching, and fixes and additions for
the Write file and Tbl filenames.  Filename mangling is performed if
the filesystem is not HPFS.

Mark Hessling's very nice PDCurses 2.1 was used for this port. In
limited testing, I could not get the BSD curses from the emx
distribution to work correctly. It appears that PDCurses is more
complete and faster, and it compiles easily with emx/gcc or msc.

I've used the GNU awk 2.15.2 regular expression routine regex.[ch]
mainly because I'm somewhat familiar with it. It is likely that some
bytes could be saved here. The popen.[ch] routines are also
from the gawk distribution (with minor changes). See COPYING
and COPYING.EMX for the appropriate copyright information.

sc has a lengthy history, and some questionable coding practices. 
In particular, there are some comparison of doubles in interp.c which
will break under optimization in emx/gcc (hence the -ffloat-store for
this module). The problem compare is 
	    if ((p->cellerror = cellerror) || (v != p->v)) {
in RealEvalOne().

The context diffs are from the June-92 archive--this appears to have
some minor changes over the original post of sc-6.21.


** 15-Nov-92 Darrel Hankerson hankedr@mail.auburn.edu

PDCurses 2.0. Use bison on gram.y due to syntax problems.


**29-Oct-92 

PDCurses 2.0 beta


**27-Oct-92

Original port, adapted from Walter's port
