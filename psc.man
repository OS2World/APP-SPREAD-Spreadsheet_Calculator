NAME
     psc - prepare sc files

SYNOPSIS
     psc [ -_f_L_k_r_S_P_v ] [ -_s _c_e_l_l ] [ -_R _n ] [ -_C _n ] [ -_n _n ] [ -_d
     _c ]


DESCRIPTION
     _P_s_c is used to prepare data for input to  the  spread  sheet
     calculator  _s_c(_1).  It accepts normal ascii data on standard
     input.  Standard output is a _s_c file.  With no options,  _p_s_c
     starts  the spread sheet in cell A0.  Strings are right jus-
     tified.  All data on a line is entered on the same row;  new
     input lines cause the output row number to increment by one.
     The default delimiters are tab and space.  The  column  for-
     mats  are  set  to  one  larger  than  the number of columns
     required to hold the largest value in the column.

     Options:


     -f   Omit column width calculations.   This  option  is  for
          preparing   data   to   be   merged  with  an  existing
          spreadsheet.  If  the  option  is  not  specified,  the
          column  widths calculated for the data read by _p_s_c will
          override those already set in the existing spreadsheet.


     -L   Left justify strings.


     -k   Keep all delimiters.  This  option  causes  the  output
          cell to change on each new delimiter encountered in the
          input stream.   The default action is to condense  mul-
          tiple  delimters  to one, so that the cell only changes
          once per input data item.


     -r   Output the data by row first then  column.   For  input
          consisting  of a single column, this option will result
          in output of one row with multiple columns instead of a
          single column spread sheet.


     -s cell
          Start the top left corner of the spread sheet in  _c_e_l_l.
          For  example,  -_s  _B_3_3  will arrange the output data so
          that the spread sheet starts in column B, row 33.


     -R n Increment by _n on each new output row.



                                                                1

     -C n Increment by _n on each new output column.


     -n n Output _n rows before  advancing  to  the  next  column.
          This  option  is  used  when the input is arranged in a
          single column and the spread sheet is to have  multiple
          columns, each of which is to be length _n.


     -d c Use the single character _c  as  the  delimiter  between
          input fields.


     -P   Plain numbers only.  A field  is  a  number  only  when
          there is no imbeded [-+eE].


     -S   All numbers are strings.


     -v   Print the version of psc
